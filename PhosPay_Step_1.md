1. The first step in a PhosPay transaction consists of the following:
- Payor Adam indicates his wish to pay Payee Brenda USD 1, by sending a encrypted message to Brenda, using Brenda's public key.
- As such, Brenda must publish her public key on her social media post, so that Adam or anyone else who wishes to tip her, may use her public key for PhosPay transaction.

2. Brenda uses a PhosPay app to generate her public and private key pairs. As PhosPay is now still in development, we use a web based prototype to demonstrate the functions required.
