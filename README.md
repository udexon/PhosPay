### PhosPay: Phos Payment Protocol &ndash; Finally, THE _Financially_ Free Software

Smart contract, like codeless and serverless, seems to be an over-hyped snake oil, where their open source implementations are far lagging behind "expectations", or downright poorly documented.

PhosPay might just be the most definitive implementation of smart contract, as our implementation and documentation are designed to be verified by peers and adopted by collaborators.  As such, we hope that PhosPay may redefine the roadmaps of future smart contract implementations.


#### PhosPay Wallet (PhosWallet)

In [ PhosPay Online Tipping ](https://github.com/udexon/PhosPay/blob/master/PhosPay_Scenarios.md), we describe an online tipping scheme based on ID-less asymetric cryptography. Based on the concepts described above, we describe an entity called PhosPay Wallet or PhosWallet, which accumulates the tipping amount on behalf of the Payee, before the Payee is even notified of the credits the Payee is eligible to claim. 

_The minimal condition for this transaction is that the Payee shall advertise his (her) public key on his social media account. Further, __the public key can be generated randomly from time to time, using PhosPay compatible apps OR just equivalent algorithms__, which PhosPay shall publish, strictly in accordance to the spirit of free software._

Likewise, a Payor does not need to make physical or electronic payments to a PhosPay Agent, before the Payor's intention to pay the Payee of a certain amount X in currency P (including cryptocurrencies), is recorded in the Payor's PhosWallet.

As such, PhosPay acts as a smart contract, in the sense that it expresses the intention of the Payee to pay the Payor of a certain amount X in currency P, just like a conventional paper contract does.


#### Verifying Our Proposal

Conventional open source projects labelled as "smart contract" either:
- do not have a realistic short term goal (e.g. within 3 months), or 
- too few people understand the theories and proposals for implementations.

As such, our project should satisfy both criteria above to be credible.

The breakthrough in PhosPay is a result of:
- eliminating the conventional Unix style user ID, and 
- applying asymetric cryptography in completely novel ways.
