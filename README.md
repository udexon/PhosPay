### PhosPay: Phos Payment Protocol

Smart contract, like codeless and serverless, seems to be an over-hyped snake oil, where their open source implementations are far lagging behind "expectations", or downright poorly documented.

PhosPay might just be the most definitive implementation of smart contract, as our implementation and documentation are designed to be verified by peers and adopted by collaborators.  As such, we hope that PhosPay may redefine the roadmaps of future smart contract implementations.
