### PhosPay Websocket Messaging & Transaction Management System (PhosPay-WS-MTMS / Phos-MTMS)

The design philosophy of PhosPay Websocket Messaging & Transaction Management System (PhosPay-WS-MTMS / Phos-MTMS) is to mimic the human network comprising Payor, Payee and Agents, facilitated by conventional electronic and physical means (e.g. telephone conversations, paper contracts, verbal contracts etc.) to coordinate the various stages of transactions.

As such, let us begin by considering a scenario WITHOUT Phos-MTMS, and creating a PROTOCOL amongst various parties (Payor, Payee and Agents etc.) facilitated by conventional electronic and physical means (e.g. telephone conversations, paper contracts, verbal contracts etc.) to coordinate the various stages of transactions.

Subsequently, we can then design Phos-WTMS to faciliate the transactions.
