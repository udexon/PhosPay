### PhosPay Websocket Messaging & Transaction Management System (PhosPay-WS-MTMS / Phos-MTMS)

The design philosophy of PhosPay Websocket Messaging & Transaction Management System (PhosPay-WS-MTMS / Phos-MTMS) is to mimic the human network comprising Payor, Payee and Agents, facilitated by conventional electronic and physical means (e.g. telephone conversations, paper contracts, verbal contracts etc.) to coordinate the various stages of transactions.

As such, let us begin by considering a scenario WITHOUT Phos-MTMS, and creating a PROTOCOL amongst various parties (Payor, Payee and Agents etc.) facilitated by conventional electronic and physical means (e.g. telephone conversations, paper contracts, verbal contracts etc.) to coordinate the various stages of transactions.

Subsequently, we can then design Phos-WTMS to faciliate the transactions.

Some readers may object that there is not thing very clever in this strategy, or it does not deserve to be called "smart contract".

Our rebuttal is that smart contract is still an ill defined concept with poor implementations anyway. Although we may not be able to fully qualify PhosPay as smart contract according to the definitions of some readers, what we have described above are based on sound and verifiable principles. As such, they will serve at least as some useful development towards an ideal smart contract implementation, or in plain English, a step in the right direction.

Consider:
- the human network comprising Payor, Payee and Agents, facilitated by conventional electronic and physical means (e.g. telephone conversations, paper contracts, verbal contracts etc.) to coordinate the various stages of transactions, to perform online tipping of USD 1.
